# URL-Shortener-app
To use the HTML files in the URL shortener code, you need to ensure that the HTML files are placed in a folder named templates within the same directory as the URL Shortener.py file.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.Create a new folder in the same directory as the URL Shortener.py file and name it templates.

2.Inside the templates folder, move the two HTML files: index.html and result.html.

After completing these steps, the Flask application will be able to find and use the HTML templates when rendering the corresponding routes.
